# Code Standard (C++)
## Indentation
Use 1 tab for indentation
## Rule of naming variables
All variables are written in lowercase, every word is separated by an "_". And the name of variables should be clear that others can easily know what is the meaning of it.
#### int switch_num; // right
#### int switch_Num; // wrong
#### int switchnum;  // wrong
## Numbers of characters in each line
Each line contains a maximum of 100 characters (include comment)
## Functions
### Maximum lines in a function
The function should have no more than 50 lines, and keep it short
### Rule of naming variables
Use CamelCase and the first letter should be lowercase
#### myFunction() // right
#### myfunction() // wrong
#### MyFunction() // wrong
## Rules of empty lines
* At least one empty line between functions
+ If the code is too long, you need to branch to ensure that the maximum number of characters per line is not exceeded
## Other rules
* Comments should preferably be aligned with the corresponding code block
+ There is no space before the semicolon
- No Chinese appears except for code comments
